BUILDING THE KERNEL

  In CyanogenMod 9, kernel building is now integrated into the Android Build
  System and building through the Android Build System is the only supported
  method of building the kernel.

  Run the following command in the root directory of your Android tree to
  build the kernel. (Replacing galaxysmtd with your build target.)

        make -j4 out/target/product/galaxysmtd/boot.img

  The resulting boot.img will be stored at

        out/target/product/galaxysmtd/boot.img

  And the kernel modules will be stored at

        out/target/product/galaxysmtd/system/lib/modules/

  Note: If you are building the entire system image, there is no need to
        manually build the kernel. Building the kernel is fully integrated
        into the Android Build System. This instruction is provided in case
        you need to build only the kernel.
